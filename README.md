# CS2 Sound List

A complete list of CS2 sounds as of 1/5/2024.

The primary use-case for this list is to be used for a refrence point when creating in-game binds to add additional sounds.

# Export Process

To export an updated list of sound directories, the following process can be followed.
Please note; I will be using [VPKEdit](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VPKEdit) to extract the packaged game contents.

1. Launch VPKEdit
2. `File -> Open` and locate your CS2 game directory within steamapps folder `C:\ProgramFiles (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive`
3. Locate the .VPK package `game\csgo\pak01_dir.vpk`
4. Find the "sounds" folder after the .vpk package has imported into VPKEdit
5. Right click and select `Extract Folder...`
6. This will then create a new folder with all exported sound files within.
